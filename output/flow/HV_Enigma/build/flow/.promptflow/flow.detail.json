Avantika wants to win by successfully placing queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. \n\nThe challenge is to help Avantika find all distinct solutions to this n-queens puzzle. Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists. Each inner list contains a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) representing a valid configuration of the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Sample Testcases\n\n#### Sample Input 1:\n```plaintext\n4\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 1:\n```plaintext\n[[2, 4, 1, 3], [3, 1, 4, 2]]\n```\n\n#### Explanation 1:\nFor \\( n = 4 \\), there are two distinct solutions:\n1. Place queens at [2, 4, 1, 3]: \n   - 1st column in 2nd row\n   - 2nd column in 4th row\n   - 3rd column in 1st row\n   - 4th column in 3rd row\n\n2. Place queens at [3, 1, 4, 2]: \n   - 1st column in 3rd row\n   - 2nd column in 1st row\n   - 3rd column in 4th row\n   - 4th column in 2nd row\n\n#### Sample Input 2:\n```plaintext\n1\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 2:\n```plaintext\n[[1]]\n```\n\n#### Explanation 2:\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), there is only one solution:\n1. Place the queen at [1]: \n   - 1st column in 1st row\n\nSure! Here is the rephrased solution code according to the problem statement, including user input handling and rephrased comments, function name, and variables.\n\n```python\ndef avantikas_n_queens_challenge(board_size):\n    def is_valid_position(queens, new_row):\n        new_col = len(queens)\n        for col in range(new_col):\n            if abs(queens[col] - new_row) in (0, new_col - col):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def solve_n_queens(queens):\n        col = len(queens)\n        if col == board_size:\n            solutions.append(queens)\n            return\n        for row in range(1, board_size + 1):\n            if is_valid_position(queens, row):\n                solve_n_queens(queens + [row])\n\n    solutions = []\n    solve_n_queens([])\n    return solutions\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input().strip())\n\n# Get all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle\nresult = avantikas_n_queens_challenge(n)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `avantikas_n_queens_challenge` which takes the size of the chessboard as input and returns all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. The function uses a helper function `is_valid_position` to check if a queen can be placed in a given row without being attacked. The `solve_n_queens` function recursively builds the solution by placing queens column by column. The solutions are stored in the `solutions` list and returned at the end. The user input is read and the result is printed in the required format.\n\n### Editorial: Avantika's Chess Challenge\n\n#### Intuition\n\nThe n-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and backtracking. The primary challenge is to place \\( n \\) queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the task is to find all possible ways to place the queens in such a manner that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\), a direct approach that generates and checks all possible configurations is infeasible due to the exponential growth in potential configurations. Instead, we need an optimized backtracking approach to systematically explore valid placements and prune invalid branches early.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Backtracking**: This is a depth-first search (DFS) technique where we try to place queens one column at a time and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid configuration.\n2. **Constraints Checking**: For each queen placement, we need to ensure that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal. This can be efficiently checked using additional sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n3. **Recursive Placement**: We start placing queens from the first column and move towards the last column. For each column, we try placing a queen in every possible row that is not under attack by another queen.\n\n#### Code\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef solveNQueens(n):\n    def is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n        return not (rows[row] or hills[row - col] or dales[row + col])\n\n    def place_queen(row, col):\n        queens.add((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 1\n        hills[row - col] = 1\n        dales[row + col] = 1\n\n    def remove_queen(row, col):\n        queens.remove((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 0\n        hills[row - col] = 0\n        dales[row + col] = 0\n\n    def add_solution():\n        solution = []\n        for _, col in sorted(queens):\n            solution.append(col + 1)\n        output.append(solution)\n\n    def backtrack(row = 0):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n                place_queen(row, col)\n                if row + 1 == n:\n                    add_solution()\n                else:\n                    backtrack(row + 1)\n                remove_queen(row, col)\n\n    rows = [0] * n\n    hills = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    dales = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    queens = set()\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nprint(solveNQueens(n))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `is_not_under_attack(row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` would be safe by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, hill diagonal, or dale diagonal.\n   - `place_queen(row, col)`: Places a queen at `(row, col)` and marks the row, hill, and dale as attacked.\n   - `remove_queen(row, col)`: Removes a queen from `(row, col)` and unmarks the row, hill, and dale.\n   - `add_solution()`: Converts the set of queen positions into the required permutation format and adds it to the output list.\n\n2. **Backtracking**:\n   - `backtrack(row)`: Attempts to place queens column by column starting from the given row. If a valid position is found, it recursively attempts to place the next queen. If all queens are placed (`row + 1 == n`), it adds the current configuration to the output.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Initializes arrays and sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n   - Starts the backtracking process from the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores valid configurations and prunes invalid ones early, making it suitable for solving the n-queens puzzle even for larger values of \\( n \\).\n\nSure, I can help you create a Python program that generates the test cases and stores them in the respective files. This program will also execute the `solution.py` script with the generated inputs and store the corresponding outputs in the output files.\n\nHere is the Python program:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Function to generate test cases\ndef generate_test_cases():\n    # Basic test cases\n    basic_cases = [4, 1, 5, 8]\n    corner_cases = [10, 20]\n    edge_cases = [100, 1000]\n    boundary_cases = [99999, 100000]\n    \n    all_cases = {\n        \"basic\": basic_cases,\n        \"corner\": corner_cases,\n        \"edge\": edge_cases,\n        \"boundary\": boundary_cases\n    }\n    \n    case_counter = {\n        \"basic\": 1,\n        \"corner\": 1,\n        \"edge\": 1,\n        \"boundary\": 1\n    }\n    \n    # Create input files\n    for case_type, cases in all_cases.items():\n        for n in cases:\n            file_name = f\"{case_type}_input_{case_counter[case_type]}.txt\"\n            with open(file_name, \"w\") as f:\n                f.write(f\"{n}\\n\")\n            case_counter[case_type] += 1\n\n# Function to run solution.py with the generated input files and store the output\ndef run_solution_and_store_output():\n    # Get all input files\n    input_files = [f for f in os.listdir() if f.endswith(\"_input_1.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_2.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_3.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_4.txt\")]\n    \n    for input_file in input_files:\n        output_file = input_file.replace(\"input\", \"output\")\n        with open(input_file, \"r\") as infile, open(output_file, \"w\") as outfile:\n            result = subprocess.run([\"python3\", \"solution.py\"], stdin=infile, stdout=outfile)\n            if result.returncode != 0:\n                print(f\"Error running solution.py with {input_file}\")\n\n# Generate test cases\ngenerate_test_cases()\n\n# Run solution.py and store output\nrun_solution_and_store_output()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generate Test Cases:**\n   - We define the test cases for basic, corner, edge, and boundary scenarios.\n   - We create a dictionary `all_cases` that holds these test cases.\n   - For each test case type, we iterate through the cases and write the input `n` to a corresponding input file.\n\n2. **Run Solution and Store Output:**\n   - We list all the input files in the current directory that match the pattern for input files.\n   - For each input file, we determine the corresponding output file name.\n   - We run `solution.py` with the input file and capture the output in the corresponding output file using `subprocess.run`.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that `solution.py` is in the same directory as this script.\n- This script assumes that `solution.py` reads from standard input and writes to standard output.\n\nYou can run this Python script to generate the input and output files for the test cases."

Avantika wants to win by successfully placing queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. \n\nThe challenge is to help Avantika find all distinct solutions to this n-queens puzzle. Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists.

              "output": "### Editorial: Avantika's Chess Challenge\n\n#### Intuition\n\nThe n-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and backtracking. The primary challenge is to place \\( n \\) queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the task is to find all possible ways to place the queens in such a manner that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\), a direct approach that generates and checks all possible configurations is infeasible due to the exponential growth in potential configurations. Instead, we need an optimized backtracking approach to systematically explore valid placements and prune invalid branches early.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Backtracking**: This is a depth-first search (DFS) technique where we try to place queens one column at a time and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid configuration.\n2. **Constraints Checking**: For each queen placement, we need to ensure that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal. This can be efficiently checked using additional sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n3. **Recursive Placement**: We start placing queens from the first column and move towards the last column. For each column, we try placing a queen in every possible row that is not under attack by another queen.\n\n#### Code\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef solveNQueens(n):\n    def is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n        return not (rows[row] or hills[row - col] or dales[row + col])\n\n    def place_queen(row, col):\n        queens.add((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 1\n        hills[row - col] = 1\n        dales[row + col] = 1\n\n    def remove_queen(row, col):\n        queens.remove((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 0\n        hills[row - col] = 0\n        dales[row + col] = 0\n\n    def add_solution():\n        solution = []\n        for _, col in sorted(queens):\n            solution.append(col + 1)\n        output.append(solution)\n\n    def backtrack(row = 0):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n                place_queen(row, col)\n                if row + 1 == n:\n                    add_solution()\n                else:\n                    backtrack(row + 1)\n                remove_queen(row, col)\n\n    rows = [0] * n\n    hills = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    dales = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    queens = set()\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nprint(solveNQueens(n))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `is_not_under_attack(row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` would be safe by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, hill diagonal, or dale diagonal.\n   - `place_queen(row, col)`: Places a queen at `(row, col)` and marks the row, hill, and dale as attacked.\n   - `remove_queen(row, col)`: Removes a queen from `(row, col)` and unmarks the row, hill, and dale.\n   - `add_solution()`: Converts the set of queen positions into the required permutation format and adds it to the output list.\n\n2. **Backtracking**:\n   - `backtrack(row)`: Attempts to place queens column by column starting from the given row. If a valid position is found, it recursively attempts to place the next queen. If all queens are placed (`row + 1 == n`), it adds the current configuration to the output.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Initializes arrays and sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n   - Starts the backtracking process from the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores valid configurations and prunes invalid ones early, making it suitable for solving the n-queens puzzle even for larger values of \\( n \\).",

Avantika wants to win by successfully placing queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. \n\nThe challenge is to help Avantika find all distinct solutions to this n-queens puzzle. Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists.

                "input3": "### Editorial: Avantika's Chess Challenge\n\n#### Intuition\n\nThe n-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and backtracking. The primary challenge is to place \\( n \\) queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the task is to find all possible ways to place the queens in such a manner that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\), a direct approach that generates and checks all possible configurations is infeasible due to the exponential growth in potential configurations. Instead, we need an optimized backtracking approach to systematically explore valid placements and prune invalid branches early.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Backtracking**: This is a depth-first search (DFS) technique where we try to place queens one column at a time and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid configuration.\n2. **Constraints Checking**: For each queen placement, we need to ensure that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal. This can be efficiently checked using additional sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n3. **Recursive Placement**: We start placing queens from the first column and move towards the last column. For each column, we try placing a queen in every possible row that is not under attack by another queen.\n\n#### Code\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef solveNQueens(n):\n    def is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n        return not (rows[row] or hills[row - col] or dales[row + col])\n\n    def place_queen(row, col):\n        queens.add((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 1\n        hills[row - col] = 1\n        dales[row + col] = 1\n\n    def remove_queen(row, col):\n        queens.remove((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 0\n        hills[row - col] = 0\n        dales[row + col] = 0\n\n    def add_solution():\n        solution = []\n        for _, col in sorted(queens):\n            solution.append(col + 1)\n        output.append(solution)\n\n    def backtrack(row = 0):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n                place_queen(row, col)\n                if row + 1 == n:\n                    add_solution()\n                else:\n                    backtrack(row + 1)\n                remove_queen(row, col)\n\n    rows = [0] * n\n    hills = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    dales = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    queens = set()\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nprint(solveNQueens(n))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `is_not_under_attack(row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` would be safe by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, hill diagonal, or dale diagonal.\n   - `place_queen(row, col)`: Places a queen at `(row, col)` and marks the row, hill, and dale as attacked.\n   - `remove_queen(row, col)`: Removes a queen from `(row, col)` and unmarks the row, hill, and dale.\n   - `add_solution()`: Converts the set of queen positions into the required permutation format and adds it to the output list.\n\n2. **Backtracking**:\n   - `backtrack(row)`: Attempts to place queens column by column starting from the given row. If a valid position is found, it recursively attempts to place the next queen. If all queens are placed (`row + 1 == n`), it adds the current configuration to the output.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Initializes arrays and sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n   - Starts the backtracking process from the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores valid configurations and prunes invalid ones early, making it suitable for solving the n-queens puzzle even for larger values of \\( n \\).",

Avantika wants to win by successfully placing queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. \n\nThe challenge is to help Avantika find all distinct solutions to this n-queens puzzle. Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists. Each inner list contains a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) representing a valid configuration of the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Sample Testcases\n\n#### Sample Input 1:\n```plaintext\n4\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 1:\n```plaintext\n[[2, 4, 1, 3], [3, 1, 4, 2]]\n```\n\n#### Explanation 1:\nFor \\( n = 4 \\), there are two distinct solutions:\n1. Place queens at [2, 4, 1, 3]: \n   - 1st column in 2nd row\n   - 2nd column in 4th row\n   - 3rd column in 1st row\n   - 4th column in 3rd row\n\n2. Place queens at [3, 1, 4, 2]: \n   - 1st column in 3rd row\n   - 2nd column in 1st row\n   - 3rd column in 4th row\n   - 4th column in 2nd row\n\n#### Sample Input 2:\n```plaintext\n1\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 2:\n```plaintext\n[[1]]\n```\n\n#### Explanation 2:\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), there is only one solution:\n1. Place the queen at [1]: \n   - 1st column in 1st row\n\nSure! Here is the rephrased solution code according to the problem statement, including user input handling and rephrased comments, function name, and variables.\n\n```python\ndef avantikas_n_queens_challenge(board_size):\n    def is_valid_position(queens, new_row):\n        new_col = len(queens)\n        for col in range(new_col):\n            if abs(queens[col] - new_row) in (0, new_col - col):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def solve_n_queens(queens):\n        col = len(queens)\n        if col == board_size:\n            solutions.append(queens)\n            return\n        for row in range(1, board_size + 1):\n            if is_valid_position(queens, row):\n                solve_n_queens(queens + [row])\n\n    solutions = []\n    solve_n_queens([])\n    return solutions\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input().strip())\n\n# Get all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle\nresult = avantikas_n_queens_challenge(n)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `avantikas_n_queens_challenge` which takes the size of the chessboard as input and returns all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. The function uses a helper function `is_valid_position` to check if a queen can be placed in a given row without being attacked. The `solve_n_queens` function recursively builds the solution by placing queens column by column. The solutions are stored in the `solutions` list and returned at the end. The user input is read and the result is printed in the required format.\n\n### Editorial: Avantika's Chess Challenge\n\n#### Intuition\n\nThe n-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and backtracking. The primary challenge is to place \\( n \\) queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the task is to find all possible ways to place the queens in such a manner that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\), a direct approach that generates and checks all possible configurations is infeasible due to the exponential growth in potential configurations. Instead, we need an optimized backtracking approach to systematically explore valid placements and prune invalid branches early.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Backtracking**: This is a depth-first search (DFS) technique where we try to place queens one column at a time and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid configuration.\n2. **Constraints Checking**: For each queen placement, we need to ensure that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal. This can be efficiently checked using additional sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n3. **Recursive Placement**: We start placing queens from the first column and move towards the last column. For each column, we try placing a queen in every possible row that is not under attack by another queen.\n\n#### Code\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef solveNQueens(n):\n    def is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n        return not (rows[row] or hills[row - col] or dales[row + col])\n\n    def place_queen(row, col):\n        queens.add((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 1\n        hills[row - col] = 1\n        dales[row + col] = 1\n\n    def remove_queen(row, col):\n        queens.remove((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 0\n        hills[row - col] = 0\n        dales[row + col] = 0\n\n    def add_solution():\n        solution = []\n        for _, col in sorted(queens):\n            solution.append(col + 1)\n        output.append(solution)\n\n    def backtrack(row = 0):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n                place_queen(row, col)\n                if row + 1 == n:\n                    add_solution()\n                else:\n                    backtrack(row + 1)\n                remove_queen(row, col)\n\n    rows = [0] * n\n    hills = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    dales = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    queens = set()\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nprint(solveNQueens(n))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `is_not_under_attack(row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` would be safe by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, hill diagonal, or dale diagonal.\n   - `place_queen(row, col)`: Places a queen at `(row, col)` and marks the row, hill, and dale as attacked.\n   - `remove_queen(row, col)`: Removes a queen from `(row, col)` and unmarks the row, hill, and dale.\n   - `add_solution()`: Converts the set of queen positions into the required permutation format and adds it to the output list.\n\n2. **Backtracking**:\n   - `backtrack(row)`: Attempts to place queens column by column starting from the given row. If a valid position is found, it recursively attempts to place the next queen. If all queens are placed (`row + 1 == n`), it adds the current configuration to the output.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Initializes arrays and sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n   - Starts the backtracking process from the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores valid configurations and prunes invalid ones early, making it suitable for solving the n-queens puzzle even for larger values of \\( n \\).\n\nSure, I can help you create a Python program that generates the test cases and stores them in the respective files. This program will also execute the `solution.py` script with the generated inputs and store the corresponding outputs in the output files.\n\nHere is the Python program:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Function to generate test cases\ndef generate_test_cases():\n    # Basic test cases\n    basic_cases = [4, 1, 5, 8]\n    corner_cases = [10, 20]\n    edge_cases = [100, 1000]\n    boundary_cases = [99999, 100000]\n    \n    all_cases = {\n        \"basic\": basic_cases,\n        \"corner\": corner_cases,\n        \"edge\": edge_cases,\n        \"boundary\": boundary_cases\n    }\n    \n    case_counter = {\n        \"basic\": 1,\n        \"corner\": 1,\n        \"edge\": 1,\n        \"boundary\": 1\n    }\n    \n    # Create input files\n    for case_type, cases in all_cases.items():\n        for n in cases:\n            file_name = f\"{case_type}_input_{case_counter[case_type]}.txt\"\n            with open(file_name, \"w\") as f:\n                f.write(f\"{n}\\n\")\n            case_counter[case_type] += 1\n\n# Function to run solution.py with the generated input files and store the output\ndef run_solution_and_store_output():\n    # Get all input files\n    input_files = [f for f in os.listdir() if f.endswith(\"_input_1.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_2.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_3.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_4.txt\")]\n    \n    for input_file in input_files:\n        output_file = input_file.replace(\"input\", \"output\")\n        with open(input_file, \"r\") as infile, open(output_file, \"w\") as outfile:\n            result = subprocess.run([\"python3\", \"solution.py\"], stdin=infile, stdout=outfile)\n            if result.returncode != 0:\n                print(f\"Error running solution.py with {input_file}\")\n\n# Generate test cases\ngenerate_test_cases()\n\n# Run solution.py and store output\nrun_solution_and_store_output()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generate Test Cases:**\n   - We define the test cases for basic, corner, edge, and boundary scenarios.\n   - We create a dictionary `all_cases` that holds these test cases.\n   - For each test case type, we iterate through the cases and write the input `n` to a corresponding input file.\n\n2. **Run Solution and Store Output:**\n   - We list all the input files in the current directory that match the pattern for input files.\n   - For each input file, we determine the corresponding output file name.\n   - We run `solution.py` with the input file and capture the output in the corresponding output file using `subprocess.run`.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that `solution.py` is in the same directory as this script.\n- This script assumes that `solution.py` reads from standard input and writes to standard output.\n\nYou can run this Python script to generate the input and output files for the test cases."

This program will also execute the `solution.py` script with the generated inputs and store the corresponding outputs in the output files.\n\nHere is the Python program:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Function to generate test cases\ndef generate_test_cases():\n    # Basic test cases\n    basic_cases = [4, 1, 5, 8]\n    corner_cases = [10, 20]\n    edge_cases = [100, 1000]\n    boundary_cases = [99999, 100000]\n    \n    all_cases = {\n        \"basic\": basic_cases,\n        \"corner\": corner_cases,\n        \"edge\": edge_cases,\n        \"boundary\": boundary_cases\n    }\n    \n    case_counter = {\n        \"basic\": 1,\n        \"corner\": 1,\n        \"edge\": 1,\n        \"boundary\": 1\n    }\n    \n    # Create input files\n    for case_type, cases in all_cases.items():\n        for n in cases:\n            file_name = f\"{case_type}_input_{case_counter[case_type]}.txt\"\n            with open(file_name, \"w\") as f:\n                f.write(f\"{n}\\n\")\n            case_counter[case_type] += 1\n\n# Function to run solution.py with the generated input files and store the output\ndef run_solution_and_store_output():\n    # Get all input files\n    input_files = [f for f in os.listdir() if f.endswith(\"_input_1.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_2.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_3.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_4.txt\")]\n    \n    for input_file in input_files:\n        output_file = input_file.replace(\"input\", \"output\")\n        with open(input_file, \"r\") as infile, open(output_file, \"w\") as outfile:\n            result = subprocess.run([\"python3\", \"solution.py\"], stdin=infile, stdout=outfile)\n            if result.returncode != 0:\n                print(f\"Error running solution.py with {input_file}\")\n\n# Generate test cases\ngenerate_test_cases()\n\n# Run solution.py and store output\nrun_solution_and_store_output()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generate Test Cases:**\n   - We define the test cases for basic, corner, edge, and boundary scenarios.\n   - We create a dictionary `all_cases` that holds these test cases.\n   - For each test case type, we iterate through the cases and write the input `n` to a corresponding input file.\n\n2. **Run Solution and Store Output:**\n   - We list all the input files in the current directory that match the pattern for input files.\n   - For each input file, we determine the corresponding output file name.\n   - We run `solution.py` with the input file and capture the output in the corresponding output file using `subprocess.run`.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that `solution.py` is in the same directory as this script.\n- This script assumes that `solution.py` reads from standard input and writes to standard output.\n\nYou can run this Python script to generate the input and output files for the test cases."

In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists. Each inner list contains a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) representing a valid configuration of the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Sample Testcases\n\n#### Sample Input 1:\n```plaintext\n4\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 1:\n```plaintext\n[[2, 4, 1, 3], [3, 1, 4, 2]]\n```\n\n#### Explanation 1:\nFor \\( n = 4 \\), there are two distinct solutions:\n1.

In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists.

Avantika wants to win by successfully placing queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. \n\nThe challenge is to help Avantika find all distinct solutions to this n-queens puzzle. Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists.

Avantika wants to win by successfully placing queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. \n\nThe challenge is to help Avantika find all distinct solutions to this n-queens puzzle. Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists.

      "output": "### Editorial: Avantika's Chess Challenge\n\n#### Intuition\n\nThe n-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and backtracking. The primary challenge is to place \\( n \\) queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the task is to find all possible ways to place the queens in such a manner that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\), a direct approach that generates and checks all possible configurations is infeasible due to the exponential growth in potential configurations. Instead, we need an optimized backtracking approach to systematically explore valid placements and prune invalid branches early.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Backtracking**: This is a depth-first search (DFS) technique where we try to place queens one column at a time and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid configuration.\n2. **Constraints Checking**: For each queen placement, we need to ensure that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal. This can be efficiently checked using additional sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n3. **Recursive Placement**: We start placing queens from the first column and move towards the last column. For each column, we try placing a queen in every possible row that is not under attack by another queen.\n\n#### Code\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef solveNQueens(n):\n    def is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n        return not (rows[row] or hills[row - col] or dales[row + col])\n\n    def place_queen(row, col):\n        queens.add((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 1\n        hills[row - col] = 1\n        dales[row + col] = 1\n\n    def remove_queen(row, col):\n        queens.remove((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 0\n        hills[row - col] = 0\n        dales[row + col] = 0\n\n    def add_solution():\n        solution = []\n        for _, col in sorted(queens):\n            solution.append(col + 1)\n        output.append(solution)\n\n    def backtrack(row = 0):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n                place_queen(row, col)\n                if row + 1 == n:\n                    add_solution()\n                else:\n                    backtrack(row + 1)\n                remove_queen(row, col)\n\n    rows = [0] * n\n    hills = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    dales = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    queens = set()\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nprint(solveNQueens(n))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `is_not_under_attack(row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` would be safe by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, hill diagonal, or dale diagonal.\n   - `place_queen(row, col)`: Places a queen at `(row, col)` and marks the row, hill, and dale as attacked.\n   - `remove_queen(row, col)`: Removes a queen from `(row, col)` and unmarks the row, hill, and dale.\n   - `add_solution()`: Converts the set of queen positions into the required permutation format and adds it to the output list.\n\n2. **Backtracking**:\n   - `backtrack(row)`: Attempts to place queens column by column starting from the given row. If a valid position is found, it recursively attempts to place the next queen. If all queens are placed (`row + 1 == n`), it adds the current configuration to the output.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Initializes arrays and sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n   - Starts the backtracking process from the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores valid configurations and prunes invalid ones early, making it suitable for solving the n-queens puzzle even for larger values of \\( n \\).",

For each column, we try placing a queen in every possible row that is not under attack by another queen.\n\n#### Code\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef solveNQueens(n):\n    def is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n        return not (rows[row] or hills[row - col] or dales[row + col])\n\n    def place_queen(row, col):\n        queens.add((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 1\n        hills[row - col] = 1\n        dales[row + col] = 1\n\n    def remove_queen(row, col):\n        queens.remove((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 0\n        hills[row - col] = 0\n        dales[row + col] = 0\n\n    def add_solution():\n        solution = []\n        for _, col in sorted(queens):\n            solution.append(col + 1)\n        output.append(solution)\n\n    def backtrack(row = 0):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n                place_queen(row, col)\n                if row + 1 == n:\n                    add_solution()\n                else:\n                    backtrack(row + 1)\n                remove_queen(row, col)\n\n    rows = [0] * n\n    hills = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    dales = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    queens = set()\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nprint(solveNQueens(n))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `is_not_under_attack(row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` would be safe by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, hill diagonal, or dale diagonal.\n   - `place_queen(row, col)`: Places a queen at `(row, col)` and marks the row, hill, and dale as attacked.\n   - `remove_queen(row, col)`: Removes a queen from `(row, col)` and unmarks the row, hill, and dale.\n   - `add_solution()`: Converts the set of queen positions into the required permutation format and adds it to the output list.\n\n2. **Backtracking**:\n   - `backtrack(row)`: Attempts to place queens column by column starting from the given row. If a valid position is found, it recursively attempts to place the next queen. If all queens are placed (`row + 1 == n`), it adds the current configuration to the output.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Initializes arrays and sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n   - Starts the backtracking process from the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores valid configurations and prunes invalid ones early, making it suitable for solving the n-queens puzzle even for larger values of \\( n \\).",

The primary challenge is to place \\( n \\) queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the task is to find all possible ways to place the queens in such a manner that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\), a direct approach that generates and checks all possible configurations is infeasible due to the exponential growth in potential configurations. Instead, we need an optimized backtracking approach to systematically explore valid placements and prune invalid branches early.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Backtracking**: This is a depth-first search (DFS) technique where we try to place queens one column at a time and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid configuration.\n2. **Constraints Checking**: For each queen placement, we need to ensure that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal.

Avantika wants to win by successfully placing queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. \n\nThe challenge is to help Avantika find all distinct solutions to this n-queens puzzle. Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists. Each inner list contains a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) representing a valid configuration of the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Sample Testcases\n\n#### Sample Input 1:\n```plaintext\n4\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 1:\n```plaintext\n[[2, 4, 1, 3], [3, 1, 4, 2]]\n```\n\n#### Explanation 1:\nFor \\( n = 4 \\), there are two distinct solutions:\n1.

Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists. Each inner list contains a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) representing a valid configuration of the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Sample Testcases\n\n#### Sample Input 1:\n```plaintext\n4\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 1:\n```plaintext\n[[2, 4, 1, 3], [3, 1, 4, 2]]\n```\n\n#### Explanation 1:\nFor \\( n = 4 \\), there are two distinct solutions:\n1. Place queens at [2, 4, 1, 3]: \n   - 1st column in 2nd row\n   - 2nd column in 4th row\n   - 3rd column in 1st row\n   - 4th column in 3rd row\n\n2.

Avantika wants to win by successfully placing queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. \n\nThe challenge is to help Avantika find all distinct solutions to this n-queens puzzle. Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists.

        "input3": "### Editorial: Avantika's Chess Challenge\n\n#### Intuition\n\nThe n-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and backtracking. The primary challenge is to place \\( n \\) queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the task is to find all possible ways to place the queens in such a manner that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\), a direct approach that generates and checks all possible configurations is infeasible due to the exponential growth in potential configurations. Instead, we need an optimized backtracking approach to systematically explore valid placements and prune invalid branches early.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Backtracking**: This is a depth-first search (DFS) technique where we try to place queens one column at a time and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid configuration.\n2. **Constraints Checking**: For each queen placement, we need to ensure that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal. This can be efficiently checked using additional sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n3. **Recursive Placement**: We start placing queens from the first column and move towards the last column. For each column, we try placing a queen in every possible row that is not under attack by another queen.\n\n#### Code\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef solveNQueens(n):\n    def is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n        return not (rows[row] or hills[row - col] or dales[row + col])\n\n    def place_queen(row, col):\n        queens.add((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 1\n        hills[row - col] = 1\n        dales[row + col] = 1\n\n    def remove_queen(row, col):\n        queens.remove((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 0\n        hills[row - col] = 0\n        dales[row + col] = 0\n\n    def add_solution():\n        solution = []\n        for _, col in sorted(queens):\n            solution.append(col + 1)\n        output.append(solution)\n\n    def backtrack(row = 0):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n                place_queen(row, col)\n                if row + 1 == n:\n                    add_solution()\n                else:\n                    backtrack(row + 1)\n                remove_queen(row, col)\n\n    rows = [0] * n\n    hills = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    dales = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    queens = set()\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nprint(solveNQueens(n))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `is_not_under_attack(row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` would be safe by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, hill diagonal, or dale diagonal.\n   - `place_queen(row, col)`: Places a queen at `(row, col)` and marks the row, hill, and dale as attacked.\n   - `remove_queen(row, col)`: Removes a queen from `(row, col)` and unmarks the row, hill, and dale.\n   - `add_solution()`: Converts the set of queen positions into the required permutation format and adds it to the output list.\n\n2. **Backtracking**:\n   - `backtrack(row)`: Attempts to place queens column by column starting from the given row. If a valid position is found, it recursively attempts to place the next queen. If all queens are placed (`row + 1 == n`), it adds the current configuration to the output.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Initializes arrays and sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n   - Starts the backtracking process from the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores valid configurations and prunes invalid ones early, making it suitable for solving the n-queens puzzle even for larger values of \\( n \\).",

Avantika wants to win by successfully placing queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. \n\nThe challenge is to help Avantika find all distinct solutions to this n-queens puzzle.

            "input3": "### Editorial: Avantika's Chess Challenge\n\n#### Intuition\n\nThe n-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and backtracking. The primary challenge is to place \\( n \\) queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the task is to find all possible ways to place the queens in such a manner that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\), a direct approach that generates and checks all possible configurations is infeasible due to the exponential growth in potential configurations. Instead, we need an optimized backtracking approach to systematically explore valid placements and prune invalid branches early.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Backtracking**: This is a depth-first search (DFS) technique where we try to place queens one column at a time and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid configuration.\n2. **Constraints Checking**: For each queen placement, we need to ensure that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal. This can be efficiently checked using additional sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n3. **Recursive Placement**: We start placing queens from the first column and move towards the last column. For each column, we try placing a queen in every possible row that is not under attack by another queen.\n\n#### Code\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef solveNQueens(n):\n    def is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n        return not (rows[row] or hills[row - col] or dales[row + col])\n\n    def place_queen(row, col):\n        queens.add((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 1\n        hills[row - col] = 1\n        dales[row + col] = 1\n\n    def remove_queen(row, col):\n        queens.remove((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 0\n        hills[row - col] = 0\n        dales[row + col] = 0\n\n    def add_solution():\n        solution = []\n        for _, col in sorted(queens):\n            solution.append(col + 1)\n        output.append(solution)\n\n    def backtrack(row = 0):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n                place_queen(row, col)\n                if row + 1 == n:\n                    add_solution()\n                else:\n                    backtrack(row + 1)\n                remove_queen(row, col)\n\n    rows = [0] * n\n    hills = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    dales = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    queens = set()\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nprint(solveNQueens(n))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `is_not_under_attack(row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` would be safe by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, hill diagonal, or dale diagonal.\n   - `place_queen(row, col)`: Places a queen at `(row, col)` and marks the row, hill, and dale as attacked.\n   - `remove_queen(row, col)`: Removes a queen from `(row, col)` and unmarks the row, hill, and dale.\n   - `add_solution()`: Converts the set of queen positions into the required permutation format and adds it to the output list.\n\n2. **Backtracking**:\n   - `backtrack(row)`: Attempts to place queens column by column starting from the given row. If a valid position is found, it recursively attempts to place the next queen. If all queens are placed (`row + 1 == n`), it adds the current configuration to the output.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Initializes arrays and sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n   - Starts the backtracking process from the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores valid configurations and prunes invalid ones early, making it suitable for solving the n-queens puzzle even for larger values of \\( n \\).",

Each solution should be a distinct board configuration where the placement of the queens is represented as a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) in increasing order. In this permutation, the number in the \\(i\\)-th position represents that the queen in the \\(i\\)-th column is placed in the row with that number.\n\nFor example, the configuration \\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\) represents a \\(4 \\times 4\\) chessboard where:\n- The queen in the 1st column is placed in the 3rd row.\n- The queen in the 2nd column is placed in the 1st row.\n- The queen in the 3rd column is placed in the 4th row.\n- The queen in the 4th column is placed in the 2nd row.\n\nGiven an integer \\( n \\), find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 \\)\n\n### Input Format\n\n- A single integer \\( n \\) representing the size of the chessboard.\n\n### Output Format\n\n- A list of lists. Each inner list contains a permutation of \\([1, 2, \\ldots, n]\\) representing a valid configuration of the n-queens puzzle.\n\n### Sample Testcases\n\n#### Sample Input 1:\n```plaintext\n4\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 1:\n```plaintext\n[[2, 4, 1, 3], [3, 1, 4, 2]]\n```\n\n#### Explanation 1:\nFor \\( n = 4 \\), there are two distinct solutions:\n1. Place queens at [2, 4, 1, 3]: \n   - 1st column in 2nd row\n   - 2nd column in 4th row\n   - 3rd column in 1st row\n   - 4th column in 3rd row\n\n2. Place queens at [3, 1, 4, 2]: \n   - 1st column in 3rd row\n   - 2nd column in 1st row\n   - 3rd column in 4th row\n   - 4th column in 2nd row\n\n#### Sample Input 2:\n```plaintext\n1\n```\n\n#### Sample Output 2:\n```plaintext\n[[1]]\n```\n\n#### Explanation 2:\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), there is only one solution:\n1. Place the queen at [1]: \n   - 1st column in 1st row\n\nSure! Here is the rephrased solution code according to the problem statement, including user input handling and rephrased comments, function name, and variables.\n\n```python\ndef avantikas_n_queens_challenge(board_size):\n    def is_valid_position(queens, new_row):\n        new_col = len(queens)\n        for col in range(new_col):\n            if abs(queens[col] - new_row) in (0, new_col - col):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def solve_n_queens(queens):\n        col = len(queens)\n        if col == board_size:\n            solutions.append(queens)\n            return\n        for row in range(1, board_size + 1):\n            if is_valid_position(queens, row):\n                solve_n_queens(queens + [row])\n\n    solutions = []\n    solve_n_queens([])\n    return solutions\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input().strip())\n\n# Get all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle\nresult = avantikas_n_queens_challenge(n)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `avantikas_n_queens_challenge` which takes the size of the chessboard as input and returns all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. The function uses a helper function `is_valid_position` to check if a queen can be placed in a given row without being attacked. The `solve_n_queens` function recursively builds the solution by placing queens column by column. The solutions are stored in the `solutions` list and returned at the end. The user input is read and the result is printed in the required format.\n\n### Editorial: Avantika's Chess Challenge\n\n#### Intuition\n\nThe n-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and backtracking. The primary challenge is to place \\( n \\) queens on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the task is to find all possible ways to place the queens in such a manner that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nGiven the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\), a direct approach that generates and checks all possible configurations is infeasible due to the exponential growth in potential configurations. Instead, we need an optimized backtracking approach to systematically explore valid placements and prune invalid branches early.\n\n#### Approach\n\n1. **Backtracking**: This is a depth-first search (DFS) technique where we try to place queens one column at a time and backtrack whenever we encounter an invalid configuration.\n2. **Constraints Checking**: For each queen placement, we need to ensure that no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal. This can be efficiently checked using additional sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n3. **Recursive Placement**: We start placing queens from the first column and move towards the last column. For each column, we try placing a queen in every possible row that is not under attack by another queen.\n\n#### Code\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef solveNQueens(n):\n    def is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n        return not (rows[row] or hills[row - col] or dales[row + col])\n\n    def place_queen(row, col):\n        queens.add((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 1\n        hills[row - col] = 1\n        dales[row + col] = 1\n\n    def remove_queen(row, col):\n        queens.remove((row, col))\n        rows[row] = 0\n        hills[row - col] = 0\n        dales[row + col] = 0\n\n    def add_solution():\n        solution = []\n        for _, col in sorted(queens):\n            solution.append(col + 1)\n        output.append(solution)\n\n    def backtrack(row = 0):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_not_under_attack(row, col):\n                place_queen(row, col)\n                if row + 1 == n:\n                    add_solution()\n                else:\n                    backtrack(row + 1)\n                remove_queen(row, col)\n\n    rows = [0] * n\n    hills = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    dales = [0] * (2 * n - 1)\n    queens = set()\n    output = []\n    backtrack()\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nprint(solveNQueens(n))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n1. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `is_not_under_attack(row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` would be safe by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, hill diagonal, or dale diagonal.\n   - `place_queen(row, col)`: Places a queen at `(row, col)` and marks the row, hill, and dale as attacked.\n   - `remove_queen(row, col)`: Removes a queen from `(row, col)` and unmarks the row, hill, and dale.\n   - `add_solution()`: Converts the set of queen positions into the required permutation format and adds it to the output list.\n\n2. **Backtracking**:\n   - `backtrack(row)`: Attempts to place queens column by column starting from the given row. If a valid position is found, it recursively attempts to place the next queen. If all queens are placed (`row + 1 == n`), it adds the current configuration to the output.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Initializes arrays and sets to track attacked rows and diagonals.\n   - Starts the backtracking process from the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores valid configurations and prunes invalid ones early, making it suitable for solving the n-queens puzzle even for larger values of \\( n \\).\n\nSure, I can help you create a Python program that generates the test cases and stores them in the respective files. This program will also execute the `solution.py` script with the generated inputs and store the corresponding outputs in the output files.\n\nHere is the Python program:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Function to generate test cases\ndef generate_test_cases():\n    # Basic test cases\n    basic_cases = [4, 1, 5, 8]\n    corner_cases = [10, 20]\n    edge_cases = [100, 1000]\n    boundary_cases = [99999, 100000]\n    \n    all_cases = {\n        \"basic\": basic_cases,\n        \"corner\": corner_cases,\n        \"edge\": edge_cases,\n        \"boundary\": boundary_cases\n    }\n    \n    case_counter = {\n        \"basic\": 1,\n        \"corner\": 1,\n        \"edge\": 1,\n        \"boundary\": 1\n    }\n    \n    # Create input files\n    for case_type, cases in all_cases.items():\n        for n in cases:\n            file_name = f\"{case_type}_input_{case_counter[case_type]}.txt\"\n            with open(file_name, \"w\") as f:\n                f.write(f\"{n}\\n\")\n            case_counter[case_type] += 1\n\n# Function to run solution.py with the generated input files and store the output\ndef run_solution_and_store_output():\n    # Get all input files\n    input_files = [f for f in os.listdir() if f.endswith(\"_input_1.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_2.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_3.txt\") or f.endswith(\"_input_4.txt\")]\n    \n    for input_file in input_files:\n        output_file = input_file.replace(\"input\", \"output\")\n        with open(input_file, \"r\") as infile, open(output_file, \"w\") as outfile:\n            result = subprocess.run([\"python3\", \"solution.py\"], stdin=infile, stdout=outfile)\n            if result.returncode != 0:\n                print(f\"Error running solution.py with {input_file}\")\n\n# Generate test cases\ngenerate_test_cases()\n\n# Run solution.py and store output\nrun_solution_and_store_output()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generate Test Cases:**\n   - We define the test cases for basic, corner, edge, and boundary scenarios.\n   - We create a dictionary `all_cases` that holds these test cases.\n   - For each test case type, we iterate through the cases and write the input `n` to a corresponding input file.\n\n2. **Run Solution and Store Output:**\n   - We list all the input files in the current directory that match the pattern for input files.\n   - For each input file, we determine the corresponding output file name.\n   - We run `solution.py` with the input file and capture the output in the corresponding output file using `subprocess.run`.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that `solution.py` is in the same directory as this script.\n- This script assumes that `solution.py` reads from standard input and writes to standard output.\n\nYou can run this Python script to generate the input and output files for the test cases.",
